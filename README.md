Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on several health indicators and diagnostic measures. Using a dataset containing medical diagnostic information, the project applies machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. The final model can help in identifying high-risk individuals, assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

It contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents genetic predisposition to diabetes
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class label (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the patient has diabetes.
